        <h2>Museum of Military Glory</h2>
        <p>
          On April 26, 2005, the opening of the entire museum complex in its
          entirety took place. At first in the courtyard of the museum building
          wanted to break up beautiful flower beds, but later plans changed.
          Instead of flowers, an interesting exposition of military equipment of
          different years appeared, but, basically, it is the equipment of the
          times The Great Patriotic War. It is located on the second floor of
          the Khoinik Museum of Local Lore. Inside the museum there is an
          exposition dedicated to the military glory of the Gomel region from
          ancient times to modern times. Here you can see weapons, uniforms,
          special equipment.

          The museum also has a large collection of historical documents and
          rare photographs of the war years.The most colorful and elegant is the
          Victory Hall. The banners of the victorious military units of the
          Soviet Army are kept here.
