          In June 1944, the Soviet troops, using wetlocks, sledges, rafts and
          gati, presented the enemy with a deadly surprise. Tanks, people,
          artillery unexpectedly for the Germans passed through impassable
          swamps and caught the Nazis by surprise, with two main blows taking
          the German armies of the "Center" group in a pincer. As a result of
          the offensive, not only the territory of Belarus was liberated, but a
          900-kilometer gap was formed between the German army groups "South"
          and "North".
