        <h2>Memorial complex "Mass Grave"</h2>
        <p>
          On the southern outskirts of the ag. Chirkovichi, near the Parichi-Svetlogorsk road, 2806 Soviet soldiers of the 48th and 65th armies were buried, who died in 1943-1944 during the liberation of the now Svetlogorsk region from the Nazi invaders.</p>
        <p>
          The village of Cirkovichi was captured in August 1941.

          During the fighting in November 1943, units of the 65th Army liberated Cirkovichi from the Nazi invaders. In December, having concentrated large forces in this area, the Nazis launched an offensive on the right flank of the 65th Army. In stubborn battles, our troops had to retreat. The 194th Infantry Division of the 48th Army was sent to help them. The Nazi offensive was stopped.

          In 1958, a monument was erected at the mass grave in the village of Chirkovichi - a sculpture of a warrior with a wreath and helmet in his hands.
