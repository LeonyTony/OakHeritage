        <h2>Memorial complex "Ola"</h2>
        <p>
          As a result of the reconstruction of the mass burial, the memorial
          complex "Ola" was created. In 1926, 79 people lived in it, and before
          the war 168 people. During the war, residents of neighboring villages
          hid in the village of Ola and in the nearby forest, fleeing from the
          Nazis. On January 14, 1944, the village was surrounded by punishers
          and all people were driven into huts, which were then set on fire.
          Those who tried to escape were shot. Then 1758 people died, 508 of
          them women and 950 children. The village of Ola never recovered after
          the war.

          In 1958, a monument was erected on the mass grave in which civilians
          and Soviet soldiers were buried - a sculpture of a kneeling soldier
          with a wreath. Until 2020, a mass grave was located on this site, and
          in 2020 a memorial complex was opened.
