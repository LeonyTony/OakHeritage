        <h2>Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Lawrence</h2> 
        <p>
          In the 13th century, the majestic temple was destroyed during the Tatar raids.
          Through the care of His Grace Stephen, Bishop of Turov and Mozyr, a community was created in honor of Saints Cyril and Lawrence of Turov.
          For two years, the local authorities did not give consent to the allocation of land for construction in Central Park â€“ they were constantly sent to the outskirts of the city.
          And only in 2008, at a meeting with the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, the Ruling Bishop presented his request to the President.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the personal instructions of the president, the plot of land was allocated immediately, the registration of all necessary documents immediately began.On May 11, 2010, Metropolitan Filaret of Minsk and Slutsk laid the foundation stone of the future cathedral.
