        <h2>Silent Bell Monument</h2>
        <p>
          A majestic monument erected in honor of the soldiers-defenders 
          Svetlogorsk, located on the square near the Berezina embankment.
          According to the author's idea, the bell weighing about nine tons seems to have been split by the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the symbolic meanings of the crack in the bell is to emphasize,
          that the wound inflicted on Belarus by the war will not be able to heal for a long time.
          The broken bell is silent in memory of those, 
          who remained lying under it, not having lived to complete victory.
          The monument became a place of veneration for fallen soldiers
          during all the celebrations dedicated to Victory Day and memorable dates
          related to the Great Patriotic War.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the year it is decorated with flowers and wreaths from grateful residents.
           Their peaceful life today was bought at the price of the lives of people buried in this place.
           The monument is a guarantee that the living will remember the departed and will be able to learn their history.

                On one side – the faces of soldiers are depicted, as if standing
                under bullets. They express humility and willingness to die to
                protect their land. Next is the victory scene.
