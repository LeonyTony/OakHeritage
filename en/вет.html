          Vetkovsky Museum of Old Believers and Belarusian Traditions named
          after F. G. Shklyarov
        </h2>
        <p>
          Collections of unique Old Believer icons, handwritten and printed
          books, the largest collection of regional textiles (towels, elements
          of traditional costume, etc.) make the Vetkovsky Museum a unique
          phenomenon in the Belarusian and Old Believer culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are permanent expositions on three floors of the Vetkovsky
          Museum , which present the artistic culture and creativity of several
          folk traditions of the region in the south-east of Belarus. First of
          all, it is the culture of the Orthodox Belarusian village of the late
          XVII-XVIII centuries.
        </p>

          The branch of the Vetkovsky Museum, which is located in Gomel, hosts
          temporary exhibitions, events, thematic classes and master classes.
          Materials from other museums and private collections are also being
          added. Exhibitions in the halls of the branch change every three to
          five months.

              <p>
                In the museum you can see a loom – "krosny". Before that, there
                were vertical looms, but the weaver's hands quickly got tired.
                They were woven mainly in winter, when there was no agricultural
                work.

              <p>
                The book is, as it were, decomposed into its component parts:
                paper from different centuries, fragments of bindings (boards,
                leather), samples of fasteners, cast overlays with the image of
                the evangelists.
