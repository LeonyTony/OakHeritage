        <h2>St. Peter and Paul Cathedral</h2> 
        <p>
          The temple is located on the high bank of the beautiful Sozh River. In spatial construction
          , the building is an example of cross-domed architecture. The height of the cathedral is 25 meters. 
          In the plan, it is an elongated four-pointed cross. 
           The construction was finally completed in 1824.
           In 1935, the Peter and Paul Cathedral was closed. 
           Services in the cathedral resumed in the 1940s, during the occupation. In the 1960s, 
           the cathedral was closed for the second time, later it was equipped with a planetarium. 
           In the late 1980s, the cathedral was restored, after which services began to be held regularly in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 9, 1824, the Peter and Paul Church was consecrated.

          the cathedral: "part of the relics of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in the mother-of-pearl ark, which is 
          set with gold, also parts of the relics of various saints of the Orthodox Greek and Russian Churches, 
          two silver-gilded kiots ..." The relics have not survived to this day.
